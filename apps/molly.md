Molly is an improved version of Signal for Android users. Regardless of the other features it provides, it fixes the egregious battery drain when not using FCM (push notifications via Google Play services). That's a good enough reason to use it.

The fix has been [submitted](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/pull/13337) to Signal and they've ignored it for nearly over a year. Someone with influence ought to convince them to merge it.
